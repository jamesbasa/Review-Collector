                "text": "3 months ago I applied for a PPP loan through this company this company claimed that the SBA denied my loan due to my criminal history which in the passed 5yrs the only criminal history that I have is tickets but anyway the company sends me an email after 50 emails and phone calls telling me to fill something out to Appeal the SBA decision I did as asked and 1 month and 150 emails later and phone calls I haven't heard anything back from anyone since. This is tragic and the sad thing is I have a real life legit business and the fraudsters have gotten money but I can't get nothing this is BS at its fullest. ",

After providing years of financial records for our business, personal financial statements, and multiple other qualifying documents we were told the SBA loan was not an option, but other business loans were available. The end story is that the \"business loan\" we were given was a \"personal\" loan, they pulled credit scores from all 3 agencies which significantly negatively impacted personal credit. Now, instead of having a business loan I have a personal loan for $23,000 on my credit report. I could have walked into my bank and received a personal loan for twice as much without the credit pulls and knocks on my personal credit file. There was NO communication that this would happen, nor was it disclosed in loan documents. In fact, throughout the email process it was stated multiple times it was a business loan, it wasn't, that the credit pull would only happen with one reporting agency, it didn't. Transparency and proper expectations are critical to small business decisions, Dream Spring failed on both accounts in this manner. ",

In my case, it cost me 40 points on my personal FICO score. Such a load of... A BUSINESS loan should report to my D&B, Experian Business, and/or Equifax Small Business like any other business loan/financing. But not with these useless hacks. They don't even bother to tell you upfront that it will report to your personal credit report. Had I know, I NEVER would have signed the loan paperwork. Bait and switch nonsense from a bunch of sorry hacks!! And, when I called them out on it, they were like, \"Oh well\"!!!!! Don't waste your efforts.",
