As a business owner, communication during a lending/financial transaction is top on my list of 'need-to-have's. She was professional, and extremely personable in all her communication. If all of Lendistry's reps are like the account executive I worked with then Lendistry has a winning formula. If I ever require a business loan, Lendistry and the account rep I worked with will be my first call.  Thank you to my account executive and Lendistry for a terrific experience.  ",

I almost gave up when I came across Ondeck. I was lucky enough to have Trey assigned to my account. I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He was incredibly responsive, informed, efficient and in all of this madness and confusion, KIND. The whole process took a week vs the horror stories I have been hearing where people are waiting weeks and week just to get an initial response from their financial institutions and can never get a hold of anyone once they do. On the contrary with ondeck, I was in constant contact with Trey and always had access to him or one of their great customer service staff. I am so very grateful to ondeck and Trey for this assistance during this difficult time. I absolutely will use them again should I be in need of these types of services and offer my highest recommendation! ",

I gave him some basic information and he returned 2 hours later with my approval for my requested loan amount. My experience with this company, and Jeremy, was professional, swift, and pain free. I highly recommend them. ",

The OnDeck process was seamless and took less than a week from application to receiving funds. It probably would have taken less time without the Thanksgiving break.  I worked with Loan Advisor Trey Cole, which happened to be working in the same state as my business. I appreciated Trey's experience and great customer service.",

OnDeck has created something magical when it comes to receiving the funding your business needs to grow. Not to mention they have competitive rates compared to everyone else in the online lending industry. Now to the reason I love OnDeck.. My account manager, Ana. She is awesome and always on her game! She is always just a quick contact away for any questions I have and she responds immediately. She checks in to see how my business is performing and if there is anything she can do to help my business grow and expand. Love her and her hard work! Ana, thank you so much! You‚Äôre the best! If you are lucky enough to be paired up with Ana, you will not be disappointed! ",

I wouldn‚Äôt even consider a different lender now - OnDeck delivers as promised.",

They help you build your business with there loans, and likewise build your credit score because they report to the credit agencies. Our first lone had a high interest rate. I renewed a few times, was once denied, but several weeks later reapplied, they waived there fees, previous interest and refunded me at an amazing rate with 4 terms from 3 to 12 months that no one in the merchant cash advance industry can trust. Once you build a history with this company they will take care of you like no others in the industry. Brittany Smith is my account manager and she is fantastic. Forget about it.... ",

As a small and medium size business owner it's very difficult to get sufficient capital from traditional banks to finance the growth of fast growing business models. This is where companies like ondeck come in... I've probably dealt with over 50 companies like ondeck and done about a dozen deals for 6 of my businesses since i started out. ondeck BY FAR is the easiest one to work with. They offered the capital we needed at reasonable rates and i love their creative angles that allow reduction in rates as you establish your relationship with them. The entire process was good, but what made it GREAT was working with Chip Stahmer - it really felt like he was working 'for us' and was on our side. He took time to understand our needs and crafted a great solution. I'm looking forward to bringing more of my companies to ondeck in the near future. ",

We needed some working capital for various reasons and went to the \"home town\" banks that claimed they helped small businesses.  We went to 3 different banks and all 3 turned us down.  Not to mention it took 3 months per bank to reach that decision.  We had been receiving the OnDeck pre-approval offers in the mail and I thought at this point what can it hurt.  The holiday season was upon us and after wasting 9 months with the banks I applied online.  The reply back was \"more information needed\" and I tho******.here we go it's going to be declined.  Literally 5 minutes later my phone rang and it was a person from OnDeck and all he needed was 3 months of bank statements proving our cash flow.  I asked him**.that's all you need? He replied, \"Yes\".  He called me back not even 30 minutes later and told me we were approved.  Dana is the person I've been working with and she has been fabulous!  She has not told me anything that wasn't true and has been upfront and honest through the entire process.  I got my funds, bought my inventory just in time for the holiday season and was able to end the year up 3% over the previous year when we were down 5% going into holiday.  People can complain about rates and fees but in the end all I can say is I got my money when the banks wouldn't help and I ended in the positive!  OnDeck is now the ONLY people I use for funding!  ",

I'm not a fan of traditional banks anyway, so I'm happy to support companies like OnDeck.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't good at managing money, no type of loan is going to work for you.  But if you need some capital for seasonal business or equipment, this is a very easy application process and they get the cash to you quickly.  The rates are higher, but fair.  Just manage the loan properly to keep your cost of capital to a minimum.  ",

They charged $2500 origination fee, and you can not pay off early without penalty.  They will get every dime even if you pay off early.  For example, if you take the loan today and want to pay it off tomorrow you will pay 100% of the principle and 75% of the interest at loan maturity.  Basically, you can pay off early but it won't save you anything in interest.  Do not work with them unless you are desperate for working capital and have exhausted all other options.  Also, go to the Better Business Bureau New York and read all of the complaints.  Do not let the A+ BBB rating fool you.  Plenty of people have complained.",
